# kNN based Movie Recommender Engine

## Environment Used
### - Jupyter Notebook

## Packages Used
The following packages need to be installed and imported to run the notebook:
- `pandas` - for data manipulation and analysis
- `sklearn.neighbors` (NearestNeighbors) - for training and initiating kNN algorithm

## Explanation of the Assignment
This assignment involves using a k nearest neighbors algorithm to generate 5 movies similar to a user inputed movie. In addition to generating a lsit of movies, the code also displays the distances of the recommended movies to the inputed movie to showcase which ones are most similar.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

### 1. Import and inspect movie data

### 2. Initialize kNN algorithm on movie data

### 3. Code user inputed section

## Learnings

### 1. How to employ a kNN algorithm in Python using scikitlearn
### 2. How to code a user inputed section to add a feature vector to the preexisting dataset
